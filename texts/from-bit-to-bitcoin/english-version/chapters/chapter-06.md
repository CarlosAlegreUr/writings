# Chapter 6: Symmetric Encryption - Shared Secrets

*Like a lock and a key—but both parties need the same key.*

---

We've established the problem: Alice wants to send Bob a secret message, but Carol is listening on the network. How can they communicate privately?

The answer starts simple: **scramble the message so only Bob can unscramble it.**

This is called **encryption**, and the simplest form is called **symmetric encryption**—where both parties share the same secret.

## The Caesar Cipher

Let's start with one of the oldest encryption methods: the Caesar cipher, named after Julius Caesar who used it to send military messages over **2,000 years ago** (Julius Caesar lived from 100 BCE to 44 BCE, making it approximately 2,050 years ago).

The idea is beautifully simple: **shift every letter by a fixed number.**

**Example: Shift by 3**

```
Original alphabet:  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Shifted left by 1:  B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A
Shifted left by 2:  C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B
Shifted left by 3:  D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C
```

Now encode a message:

```
Original alphabet:  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
                            ↓     ↓       ↓     ↓ 
Shifted by 3:       D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C

Original message:  HELLO
H → K
E → H
L → O
L → O
O → R

Encrypted message: KHOOR
```

Alice sends "KHOOR" across the network. Carol intercepts it but sees only "KHOOR"—she has no idea what it means.

Bob receives "KHOOR" and shifts in the opposite direction, back by 3:

```
Shifted alphabet:   D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C
                            ↓     ↓       ↓     ↓ 
Original alphabet:  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

Encrypted message: KHOOR
K → H
H → E
O → L
O → L
R → O

Decrypted message: HELLO
```

**This is encryption.** The message is scrambled using a rule (in this case, shift by 3 positions to the right on the letter's position in the alphabet), and only someone who knows the rule can unscramble it.

The "rule" is called the **key**. In this case, the key is "3" (the shift amount). You can also think of the key as a password that both Alice and Bob know.

## The Password Principle

Modern encryption works on the same principle, just with much more complex math. Instead of shifting letters, computers use mathematical functions that scramble bits in ways that are extremely difficult to reverse without the key.

Think of it like this:

```
f(x) → means a math function

Like, for example: f(x) = x + 2
You've probably seen this in high school.

x can be any number. Some functions even have 2 inputs:
f(x, y) = x + y + 2

You choose the values of x and y (input, initial information),
plug them into the function, and get an output (final information).

If you chose x = 3 and y = 5:
f(3, 5) = 3 + 5 + 2 = 10

Well, you can think of encryption like that too:
f(message, password) = scrambled_message
```

**Encryption:** Alice takes her message and a password, runs them through a function, and gets scrambled gibberish.

**Decryption:** Bob takes the scrambled message and the same password, runs them through the reverse function, and gets the original message back.

The reverse function is the function that does the "opposite." If you add one, the reverse is to subtract one. Multiply by 3, then the reverse is divide by 3.

**Example:**

```
Message: "The password is banana123"
Password: "secret42"

Complex encryption function:
f("The password is banana123", "secret42") = "8x!mQ2$pL9@vN..."

Complex decryption function:
f_reverse("8x!mQ2$pL9@vN...", "secret42") = "The password is banana123"
```

Carol intercepts "8x!mQ2$pL9@vN..." but without knowing the password ("secret42"), she can't decrypt it. It's just random-looking noise to her.

**This is symmetric encryption:** Both Alice and Bob use the same secret key (password) to encrypt and decrypt.

But here's the catch: if Carol knew the function you use—the math operations involved—she could potentially break the encryption by just guessing passwords. It's easy to see why with the Caesar cipher, because there are only 25 possible shifts. So if Carol knows you're using a Caesar cipher, she can simply try shifting by 1. Still doesn't make sense? Okay, shift by 2. Still nothing? Try shifting by 3... BINGO! It makes sense. With only 25 possibilities, a computer can run through all of them very, very quickly.

## Why It's Called "Symmetric"

The name comes from the fact that the same key works in both directions:

```
Standard language          Encrypted language
  |                           |
  | --- Encrypt message --->  |
  |     (using key X)         |
  |                           |
  | <--- Decrypt message ---- |
  |     (using key X)         |
  |                           |     
```

Like a physical lock and key:
- Alice locks the box with key X
- Bob unlocks the box with the same key X
- Both parties need the exact same key

This is different from **asymmetric encryption** (which we'll cover next), where Alice and Bob use different keys:

```
Standard language          Encrypted language
  |                           |
  | --- Encrypt message --->  |
  |     (using key X)         |
  |                           |
  | <--- Decrypt message ---- |
  |     (using key Y)         |
  |                           |     
```

But that's for later.

## Modern Symmetric Encryption

The Caesar cipher is easy to break—there are only 25 possible shifts, so Carol could try all of them in seconds.

Modern symmetric encryption uses much more sophisticated algorithms that do far more than just shifting characters around. A famous and widely used algorithm is:

**AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):**
- Used everywhere: banking apps, HTTPS websites, encrypted files
- Instead of shifting letters, it scrambles bits using complex mathematical operations

**The point:** With a strong password, symmetric encryption is virtually unbreakable by brute force. The Caesar cipher needs only 25 computations to crack, but with long enough passwords and a sequence of sufficiently complex operations, it would take billions of years for even the fastest computers to try all possible passwords (keys).

So symmetric encryption is actually used in networks, but in different complex and technical ways that you don't really need to understand here. For the nerdy or curious ones, research TLS (Transport Layer Security) and how it uses symmetric encryption for fast data transfer after establishing a secure connection. For normal people reading this, just continue reading.

## The Fatal Flaw

So we've solved the problem, right? Alice and Bob can now communicate securely!

Not quite. There's a massive problem: **How do Alice and Bob agree on the password in the first place?**

Think about it:

```
Alice wants to send Bob an encrypted message.

But first, they need to agree on a password.

How does Alice tell Bob the password?

If she sends it over the Internet... Carol intercepts it!

Now Carol knows the password and can decrypt everything.
```

**This is the chicken-and-egg problem of symmetric encryption:**

- You have very nice math that allows for sending encrypted messages, but you need a shared password
- To share the password over long distances, you need... an encrypted channel
- But to have an encrypted channel, you need a shared password
- But to share the password... (infinite loop)

Note that at short distances Alice can just meet Bob in person and give him the password, but this isn't practical on the Internet where distances could span continents.

## Long-Distance Relationships Did Not Work

Throughout history, people solved this by meeting in person:

**Spies:** Two agents meet in a dark alley, exchange code books face-to-face, then communicate securely via radio.

**Military:** Soldiers receive code books before deployment. If the enemy captures a code book, all communications are compromised.

**Banking:** You go to the bank in person, they give you a PIN, then you can use ATMs and online banking.

The pattern: **Pre-shared secrets.** Alice and Bob meet in a secure location beforehand and agree on a password. Then they can communicate remotely using that password.

**But this doesn't scale to the Internet.**

You can't fly to Amazon's headquarters to exchange a password before shopping online. You can't meet face-to-face with your bank before using their website. You can't physically visit Instagram's servers to set up encryption.

The Internet connects strangers who have never met and never will. How can they establish a shared secret over a public channel where attackers are listening?

**For centuries, this seemed impossible.**

Every encryption method required pre-shared secrets, and pre-sharing secrets requires a secure channel. But how do you create a secure channel without already having a shared secret?

It seemed like a logical impossibility—like asking someone to unlock a door when the key is inside the locked room.

**This was the unsolved problem of cryptography until the 1970s.**

## Why This Matters for Bitcoin

You might be wondering: why are we talking about Caesar ciphers in a book about Bitcoin?

Because Bitcoin's security relies entirely on cryptography. Specifically:

**Bitcoin addresses—your wallet—work with asymmetric cryptographic keys.**

When you "own" Bitcoin, you don't actually possess anything physical. You possess knowledge of a secret number (a private key, a password only you should know) that mathematically proves ownership. Without that key, the Bitcoin is mathematically inaccessible to you—and to everyone else. There you go: now you have a better understanding of what a Bitcoin wallet actually is.

And because it's only information—a very big number used as an input in a math function—it can be stored anywhere: paper, hardware, titanium, your brain, etc. You choose the medium. A portable one? A durable one? It's up to you and your needs. We'll talk more about this later.

**Bitcoin transactions are signed with private keys.**

When you send Bitcoin, you're creating a transaction and signing it with your private key. This signature proves:
1. You own the Bitcoin you're spending. (Well, you own the mathematical secret that grants access to them.)
2. You authorized the transaction. (Because, allegedly, you did not share that number with anyone, so it must be you who is sending them.)
3. The transaction hasn't been tampered with. (We will logically deduce this property later.)

But what does "sign" mean? In practice, it's computing the mathematical function we saw earlier:

`f(message, private_key) = encrypted_message`.

Because this identifies you as the owner of the Bitcoin, we call it a signature—like signatures on classic paper bank checks or contracts. You can actually think of cryptocurrency signatures as classical banking checks. We'll dive deeper later.

But how does this work over a public network where anyone can watch? How do you prove you own Bitcoin access without revealing your private key? How do thousands of strangers verify your signature (do the math computation) without knowing its input (your password)?

**The answer resides in very special new properties you can achieve if you design the mathematical function cleverly enough—and that's what we call asymmetric cryptography**—the mathematical breakthrough that makes Bitcoin (and modern Internet security) possible.

But we had to understand symmetric encryption first, because it shows us the problem that asymmetric encryption solves. And because it's relatively easy to explain with simple mental models—like the math functions we saw and the Caesar cipher.

So, summing up: now you know how to properly think about encryption—very complex mathematical functions that process information, mapping inputs to outputs. Helping computers instantly "invent" a new standard language only they know how to speak.

Depending on their properties, we classify them into symmetric or asymmetric encryption.

As we have seen, the properties of symmetric encryption are:
- Both parties share the same secret key (password)
- The same key is used to encrypt and decrypt messages

But this has a core complication: how do you share the secret key in the first place over long distances without someone intercepting it?

---

**Key Insight:** Symmetric encryption scrambles messages using a shared secret password. It's unbreakable with modern algorithms like AES. But it has a fatal flaw: how do you share the password quickly and over long distances without someone intercepting it? Meeting in person works, but doesn't scale to the Internet where billions of strangers need to communicate securely without ever meeting, and quickly.

Next, we'll explore the breakthrough that solved this: **asymmetric encryption**—a mathematical magic trick that lets you send secrets without sharing passwords, and prove identity without revealing secrets. This is one of the foundational blocks of Bitcoin and all modern digital security.

For now, we are starting to truly understand what a crypto-wallet actually is. It is just a password, a bunch of information—a very cleverly chosen one.
